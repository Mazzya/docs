# Qubic Java Library (qubicj)

The Qubic Java Library (`qubicj/qubicj-computor-api`) provides an API for developers to interact with the Qubic Network.

It allows to quickly interact with the Qubic network without the need to 
know the details of the Qubic network protocol and provides features like auto node selection.
It can be used in classic or reactive stacks.

For full documentation, please visit the [Qubic Java repository](https://gitlab.com/qubic-contributions/qubicj). 
The [qubicj-shell submodule](https://gitlab.com/qubic-contributions/qubicj/-/blob/main/qubicj-shell) provides a demo on 
how to use the library in a classic Java stack with Spring.
